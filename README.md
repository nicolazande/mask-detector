## Description

This project aims to develop a machine learning solution for classifying images depicting groups of people based on the number of masked individuals. The goal is to determine the following cases in an image:

1. **All people in the image are wearing masks:** This scenario represents a group of people where every individual is correctly wearing a mask, demonstrating responsible behavior to prevent the spread of infectious diseases.

2. **No person in the image is wearing a mask:** This case highlights a group of people where none of the individuals are wearing masks, indicating a potential risk of exposure to contagious agents and the need for raising awareness about the importance of mask-wearing.

3. **Someone in the image is not wearing a mask:** This classification pertains to a group of people where most individuals might be wearing masks, but there is at least one person who is not wearing a mask correctly or at all. This class can help identify instances where safety guidelines need reinforcement or where individuals might need further education on mask usage.

The classification problem consists of three different classes, and the objective is to predict the correct class label for a given image. By providing an automated and efficient means of detecting mask-wearing in images, this project can contribute to public health efforts and facilitate monitoring adherence to safety measures in various settings, such as public gatherings, transportation, and crowded places.

The successful development of this classifier can have potential applications in various domains, including healthcare, surveillance, and public safety, aiding in assessing mask-wearing compliance and supporting decision-making processes for policy implementation and resource allocation. Additionally, the model can serve as a valuable tool for researchers, policymakers, and health authorities to analyze mask-wearing trends and patterns over time.

## Dataset

The training dataset consists of images with labeled classes for the three scenarios mentioned above. It is crucial to have a diverse and representative dataset to ensure accurate predictions.
